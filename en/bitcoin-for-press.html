<h2>Facts, FAQs and Myths</h2>

<div class="press-faq">

<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What is Bitcoin?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Bitcoin is an Internet protocol and open-source software platform that enables a new completely digital and decentralized currency called bitcoins (BTC).</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How does one acquire bitcoins?</a>
  <div>
  <ul>
    <li>Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services.</li>
    <li>Buy bitcoins at one of the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins">Bitcoin Exchanges</a>.</li>
    <li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins using one of several services.</li>
    <li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins face to face using a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:Directories">local directory</a>.</li>
    <li>Earn bitcoins through competitive <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How does Bitcoin work?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Bitcoin is a <a href="http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001325.html">triple entry bookkeeping system</a> where a public ledger of every Bitcoin transaction is validated and distributed in real-time through the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network. The whole network is secured and regulated through cryptography. Anyone can process transactions using computer processing power, often with specialized hardware, and potentially earn a reward in bitcoins for this service which is often called 'bitcoin mining'.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How does Bitcoin mining work?</a>
  <div>
  <p>While Bitcoin miners do "mine" they are not performing a function that is analogous to gold mining. Bitcoin mining is a contribution to the tending and maintenance of the information that is included in the distributed Bitcoin ledger, the blockchain. The Bitcoin mining community listens for ledger transfer announcements which are broadcast through the peer-to-peer network as transactions. The miners process and confirm these transaction by including them in the blockchain.</p>
  <p>Most Bitcoin miners perform this labor because the first to solve a block earns the block reward, a predetermined amount of bitcoins as specified by the protocol which decreases every four years, and transaction fees included by customers who include them with a transaction. Bitcoin mining is a very competitive market as the reward is divided between each miners based on computing power. There is no way for a miner to cheat to increase its own reward or to process invalid transactions in order to corrupt the Bitcoin network. Because no miner can write consecutively in the blockchain, no individuals can control what is included in the blockchain or replace parts of the blockchain to roll back their own spends. Thus, Bitcoin mining is also used to protect the neutrality and the consensus of the network.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How difficult is it to make a Bitcoin payment?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Bitcoin payments are easier to make than any existing banking or credit card process.  Payments are made from a wallet application, either from your computer or smartphone by entering the recipients address either by scanning a QR code or copying and pasting, entering the amount, and pressing send.</p>
  <p><img src="/img/press/faq/send_bitcoin_demo.jpg" style="height:300px;width:200px;" alt="Send Bitcoin"></p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What are some advantages of Bitcoin?</a>
  <div>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Unrestrained payments</em> - It is possible to send and receive any amount of money anywhere in the world at any time.  No bank holidays.  No borders.  No imposed limits. </li>
    <li><em>Low or zero fees</em> - Bitcoin payments currently process at zero or extremely small fees. Fees are paid to receive priority processing in order to have transactions validated and authenticated by the network faster. And currently available merchant tools allow merchants to process transactions with much lower fees than with Paypal or credit cards networks.</li>
    <li><em>Higher protection for merchants</em> - Bitcoin transactions are non-reversible thus saving merchants from losses caused by constant fraudulent chargebacks. Merchants also don’t need to comply with costly PCI standards to handle security. Which even allows Bitcoin to work in countries where credit cards are not available due to high fraud rates.</li>
    <li><em>Higher protection for users</em> - It is possible to send and receive payments without needing personal information to be tied to the transaction, thus protecting from identity theft. Bitcoin users are also in full control of their transactions and merchants cannot charge their customers like they do with credit cards.</li>
    <li><em>Transparency</em> - <a href="http://blockchain.info">All information</a> concerning the Bitcoin money supply is readily available on the blockchain for anybody to see, verify, measure, and use in real-time.</li>
    <li><em>Distributed</em> - The Bitcoin ledger, commonly called the blockchain, is distributed throughout the world and stored by Bitcoin miners. This adds a level of resiliency and redundancy that is unmatched in the payments space and a payment processing network. For example, the Federal Reserve does all their payment processing at 100 Orchard Street, East Rutherford, New Jersey and have back-up systems that can be brought online within 60-90 minutes at the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Dallas. If those three centers were compromised or destroyed then the entire monetary system of the Federal Reserve would be greatly impaired and probably completely nonfunctional.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What are some disadvantages of Bitcoin?</a>
  <div>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Not widely accepted</em> - Many people are still unaware of Bitcoin.  Everyday more businesses accept bitcoins because they have advantages of doing so, but the list remains small and still needs to grow in order to gain improved usefulness through networking effects.</li> 
    <li><em>Volatile</em> - The <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap">total value</a> of bitcoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Bitcoin is still very small compared to what it can be. Therefore relatively small movements in the market can significantly affect the price. In theory, volatility will persist as the market scrambles to determine a bitcoin’s value as this nascent currency matures.  Never before has the world seen a startup currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out.</li>
    <li><em>For geeks</em> - Many user tools are still not ready for everyone and users still need to protect their money by themselves, or trust young online wallet services that still don’t offer any insurance against theft or other bad events. New tools and services are constantly being developed to make Bitcoin more accessible to the masses. But from now, Bitcoin is a bright new invention that starts to meet the real world.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin secure?</a>
  <div>
  <p>The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record. Bitcoin’s vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost, stolen or compromised. Consequently, users need to employ security practices that protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance. As Bitcoin has grown in adoption more service providers have appeared to make it easier, safer and more convenient to use and safely secure bitcoins. Bitcoins are not covered by insurance schemes or depositor insurance like the FDIC but could be with a service provider that offered that service.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin legal?</a>
  <div>
  <p>To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in any jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>Additionally, regulators from various jurisdictions have taken steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology into businesses and other activities. For example, the United States' FinCEN has issued non-binding and non-determinative guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.</p>
  <p>Useful resources:</p>

  </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What about Bitcoin and taxes?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction. But often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin. Because all transactions are public record and stored permanently therefore it is likely a bad idea to attempt to use Bitcoin to evade taxes.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Does Bitcoin enable or encourage illicit activity?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant technology. However, it is not anonymous and the use of Bitcoin leaves extensive and permanent public records.</p>
  <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded on page two of the report <em>Bitcoin Virtual Currency: Unique Features Present Distinct Challenges for Deterring Illicit Activity</em> that ‘The FBI assesses with low confidence, based on current user and vendor acceptance, that malicious actors will exploit Bitcoin to launder money.’</p>
  <p>Bitcoin prevents many criminals from being able to engage in illegal behavior. Because of the way Bitcoin works customers do not need to reveal personal information to merchants. This decreases the amount of data available to illegal actors and acts as significant protection against identity theft, credit card fraud and several other attack vectors. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible which prevents chargebacks or frauds and transaction traceability means it is impossible to counterfeit bitcoins.</p>
  <p>Additionally, law enforcement authorities have already begun using sophisticated techniques to analyze Bitcoin transactions in their criminal investigations. So it may be that the Bitcoin software is not very attractive for criminal enterprises.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin a bubble?</a>
  <div>
  <p>BA fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble.  An artificial over-valuation that will suddenly downward correct constitutes a bubble.</p>
  <p>Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for bitcoin's price to fluctuate as the market seeks price discovery. Some reasons for this change in sentiment may be a loss of confidence in the currency, a large difference between value and price not based on the fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy, excessive press coverage stimulating speculative demand, fear of uncertainty and just old-fashioned irrational exuberance and greed.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Why did Bitcoin’s price crash in June 2011?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for bitcoin's price crash in June 2011. Some reasons for this change in sentiment may be a loss of confidence in the currency, the largest exchange, MtGox, having a security incident, a large difference between value and price from the large amount of press coverage which stimulated speculative demand which was not based on fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy and just old fashioned irrational exuberance and greed.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How to explain a surge in Bitcoin's value?</a>
  <div>
  <p>The price of bitcoins is determined by supply and demand and the supply is fixed at 21 million because of the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. There are two main types of demand: speculative and transactional. As more people use bitcoins to transact economic activities this increases demand and the price of bitcoins. So likewise as more people speculate on the future of Bitcoin by saving or hoarding bitcoins then this increases demand for bitcoins and the price. The result is an increase of network effects and increased adoption.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?</a>
  <div>
  <p>A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors instead of from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation.</p>
  <p>Bitcoin is an open source software project with no central authority and consequently no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies like gold, United States dollars, Euros, Yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate freely floats which can lead to volatility where owners of bitcoins can make or lose value.</p>
  <p>However, because of the irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions it can be attractive for a Ponzi scam operator and there have been several notable Ponzi scams which have failed and did use Bitcoin.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin?</a>
  <div>
  <p>The creator of Bitcoin never revealed his real identity and simply left his invention to the world. Satoshi created the first Bitcoin implementation and remained active in the development for a few years before choosing to leave the project. Meanwhile, a strong community of developers, miners, users and supporters have spontaneously emerged to continue the project.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Bitcoin is virtual and immaterial?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Bitcoin is a completely virtual currency. Bitcoin is particularly well suited for use on the Internet unlike other fiat currencies and payment systems like credit cards. Bitcoin can also be used to pay in physical store using simple mobile applications. Additionally, bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are not subject to counterparty risk like with traditional banks and this protects users from Cyprus-style problems and empowers Bitcoin users to have exclusive control of their funds.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Why do people trust Bitcoin?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Bitcoin is open-source software which means that everyone has access to all of the source code all of the time. The rules of the system are embedded into the source code and the participants all impose those rules on each other simultaneously. To change the system would require everyone to switch to a new version of the software that used different rules, and because Bitcoin users are spread across the world it is outside the power of any single jurisdictional authority to mandate such a change.</p>
  <p>Cryptography is well established and a fundamental technology used in online banking. But unlike fiat currency with central banks and online banking with heavily peer reviewed cryptographic ciphers Bitcoin has been able to construct a currency and payment network that removes the need to trust a central authority.</p>
  <p>Consequently, many people trust Bitcoin because it requires absolutely no trust at all.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Bitcoin is an anonymous currency?</a>
  <div>
  <p>Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant technology. However, it is not anonymous but pseudo-anonymous. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive and permanent public records for each transaction. All transactions can be traced since their origin and IP addresses are permanently logged by organizations listening on the network. All of these informations can easily be accessed by competitors, law enforcement or anyone else.</p>
  <p>However, there are a few technically difficult and costly methods that enable users to interact with Bitcoin in very private ways. The Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded on page two of the report <em>Bitcoin Virtual Currency: Unique Features Present Distinct Challenges for Deterring Illicit Activity</em> that ‘The FBI assesses with low confidence, based on current user and vendor acceptance, that malicious actors will exploit Bitcoin to launder money.’</p>
  <p>Transactions are difficult to conceal from best practices in network data analysis, data mining and forensic accounting techniques. In most transaction, personal information must be revealed to receive the goods or services from an order. This makes keeping full anonymity with Bitcoin transactions very difficult or impossible.</p>
